# MoneyHelper Components

This is the repository for MoneyHelper Tools/Calculators

## Notes

- All tools in this project work without JS, which means using `<form>` pretty much everywhere data is stored.
- Designs are managed with Tailwind
- Icons are SVGs and taken from https://icones.netlify.app/collection/mdi

## Quick Start

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

To work on tools run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Alternatively you can run the Storybook server for developing basic
components:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Deployment

This project is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Deploys happen automatically on a merge to the `main` branch.

Pull requests are also automatically deployed, and you'll find a link to the
preview app in your PR comments.
